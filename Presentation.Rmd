```

## Basics

* RMarkdown
    + R version of Markdown, a markup language
* YAML
    + header (RStudio builds this for you)
    + tells computer what kind of doc your building
* knitr
    + package that integrates the above (along with other components like LaTeX) to actually build the document
* RStudio has a couple of documents that flesh out most of the material in this presentation
    + [cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)
    + [reference document](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf)


## Creating a Document

* File -> New File -> R Markdown
* Select document type you want to build
    + this presentation was knit as a Slidy presentation
* Some document types have additional requirements (LaTeX, Word)
* RStudio automatically creates the apporopriate YAML header and some sample code
* When you want to create the document, click "Knit"

## RMarkdown Basics

* Starting line with #s followed by space for headers (more #s = sub-headers)

* Format is done by surrounding text with symbols (`*` or _ for italics, ** or __ for bold, for ^ for superscripts)
    + Equations are similar, surrounded by $

* These bullets were created with `*`
    + The + symbol was used for this line

* For .pdf/.doc files page breaks can be created by \newpage or \pagebreak (on its own line)

* for slides, breaks by either (sub)headers or *** on one line

## R Code in documents

* For inline code, start code with `` `r `` and end with `` ` ``.
    + e.g. to get `r sqrt(3)`, use `` `r `` ``sqrt(3)` ``. 

* For code chunks, first line is ` ```{r nameofchunk} `
    + code chunks don't need names, but can be useful
    
* Last line of chunk is ` ``` `.

* Both should be their own line

## Code Chunk Parameters
* A variety of parameters can be included within {}

* Some common ones (and their default values)
    + eval (TRUE): Should the code be run
    + echo (TRUE): should the code be displayed in doc

##Other Additonal Documents That I Lack the Time and/or Expertise to Cover

* R Notebooks

* bookdown

* flexdashboards

* ReporteRs, ackage for creating Word/PPT docs and inserting code into existing ones
    + http://davidgohel.github.io/ReporteRs/

* More math syntax (sorry)
