## Basics

* RMarkdown
    + R version of Markdown, a markup language
* YAML
    + header (RStudio builds this for you)
    + tells computer what kind of doc your building
* knitr
    + package that integrates the above (along with other components like LaTeX) to actually build the document
* RStudio has a couple of documents that flesh out most of the material in this presentation
